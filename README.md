## about portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website built for an assigment given in our university.This portfolio is basically a single page website which 
contains all sections such as home,education,skills,project,contact.
this portfolio is majorly made up of html and css and a very very little java script is used to ensure that animations do not overlap each other and so that 
they could work properly even in smaller screens ensuring responsive nature of the skills section
The page is built ensuring that it follows every thing mentioned in the given guidelines such as including navbar,different working links,animations,hover effects..etc
## home
the home page contains a name container which contains my name which took so my trouble for converting it into responsive because it is having larger font size 
so the solution i came up for this is making as many as break points until it work.atlast the trick worked
## about
In this section different types of things were arranged using flex-box ensuring responsive in smaller screens the layout itself aranges this sections my photo and a brief about me and some social 
acc links of mine to contact
## education
this section contains the  details of my education till now.it is also made via using fexbox and some hover effects to increase creativeness and page attraction
## skills
This sections is the most toughest section and my favourite section because the three different animatation were collapsing with one another so that making it
a total mess finally by using a small amount of javascript i was able to out come the problem
## projects
This sections showcases the projects i done till now and the projects i have worked in as a team mate.these projects also showcases my interest in innovation  and my hands on experince
## contact
As you can see the contact section is simply laid and formated not making any complex moves just by using flex box and forms to take input
##i think this is a beginning to my web developer journey
